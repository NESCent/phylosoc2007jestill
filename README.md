Command Line Interface to a Topological Query Application for BioSQL
====================================================================

I will use PERL to create a set of command line programs for topological queries in [BioSQL]. The goal of this project is to create an interface that is suitable for high throughput creation and modification of SQL based phylogenies. I will use this interface to further my research on the classification of plant LTR retrotransposons.

This was a Google Summer of Code project in 2007, under the Phyloinformatics Summer of Code ([NESCent]) mentoring organization. The mentor was [Hilmar Lapp]. Full information and more documentation is available at the [project homepage], which has been copied to the [Github wiki] for this project.
